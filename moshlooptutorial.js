/*
 Sometimes we want to repeat an action multiple times,
For that in Js we use loops, we have various types of loops:
For loops, While loops, Do... While loops, For... in loops,
for... of loops. All these loops essentially do the same thing.

// Basic "For" Loop - for(initialStatement; condition; incrementExpression)
// The loop below will log "Hello World" 5 times.
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
